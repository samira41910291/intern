The initial height of the $i$-th tree is $h_i$.\n","\n","You want to water these trees, so they all grow to the same height. The watering process goes as follows. You start watering trees at day 1. During the $j$-th day you can:\n","\n","- Choose a tree and water it. If the day is odd (e.g. $1$,$3$,$5$,$7$,…), then the height of the tree increases by $1$. If the day is even (e.g. $2$,$4$,$6$,$8$,…), then the height of the tree increases by $2$.\n","- Or skip a day without watering any tree.\n","\n","Note that you can't water more than one tree in a day.\n","\n","<BR>\n","<p style=\"font-weight: bold; text-align: center\">\n","Write a function that takes in an array of <code>n</code> trees (integers) and returns <BR><u>the minimum number of days required to water the trees so that they grow to the same height</u>.\n","</p>\n","<BR>\n","\n","<hr style=\"height:2px\">\n","\n","<center>\n","    <H3>\n","        Sample Inputs & Outputs\n","    </H3>\n","</center>\n","\n","Sample input(s) and output(s) are given below.
